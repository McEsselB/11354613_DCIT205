## Introduction and Purpose of The Building This Website
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
 Building websites could be for so many different reasons. In this case, the website I am building is a website for an educational instituition, that is the University of Ghana, Computer Science Department. This website will provide an environment for the members of the Computer Science Department to have access to some sort of information like upcoming events of the department, and news updates. The website could also serve great purpose to anyone else who is outside the community but will like to join the community soon. Some of these purposes the website could serve outsiders of the community is that it provides an about section that will brief anyone who visits the about us section of the home page what the purpose of computer sceince department is. Courses offered from the department are also displayed on the website so as to help anyone who will be interested in joining the community course options to choose from.
 In conlcusion, this website I am building for the University of Ghana, Computer Sceince department it to host or create an online version for the presence of the department and also to ensure the sharing of information from the department to its members, some outsiders who are interested in the community and information amongst the members of the community itself.  </p>

## Setting up your git.

   ~ git config --global user.name "example name"<br>
   ~ git congig --global user.email "example@st.ug.edu.gh"<br>
      To check if the process went through, run:<br>
   ~ git config -l<br>
     Your user name and user email will be displayed in the terminal, that is a confirmation of your git setup.<br>

## Detailed instructions on how to clone and set up the project.
 
1. In Visual Studio Code, open your open your bash terminal <br>

2. While Vs code is open, open github repo to fork  from in your browser, using this link "https://github.com/Daquiver1/DCIT_205_IA" <br>

3. In the DCIT_205_IA bar, find the fork button and click on it. <br>

4. Using this name convention “STUDENT ID_DCIT205” set a name for your repo<br>

5. From the code button drop-down list, copy the https link under the local clone section.<br>

6. Back in your git bash terminal opened in vs code, paste the link after the code :<br>
      ~git clone<br>
   For example:<br>
      ~ git clone https://github.com/Daquiver1/DCIT_205_IA.git<br>

7. Notice a README.md file appears in your current folder directory. <br>

8. If your additional code files are in a different directory, cut or copy all those files and paste it in the folder where your README.md file is. This folder will have the name you used when forking Danquiver1's repo for the IA. Example as the naming convention is “STUDENT ID_DCIT205”<br>

8. To activate your folder directory, use the command:<br>
   ~cd "while pasting your local folder path"<br>
   for example:<br>
   ~cd STUDENT ID_DCIT205<br>
   This folder will be set as your main branch<br>

9. Add files to be tracked by using cmd:<br>
   ~git add .<br>

10. To commit files, use cmd:<br>
   ~git commit -m "enter any commit message"<br>

11. To push committed files to your githhub or online repo, use cmd:<br>
   ~git push origin main<br>

## Lesson from the Project
In this Project I was able to learn a lot of crucial lessons. During the time I was developing the front-end for the Computer Science Dept. I worked with GitHub and Git. From this, I was able to learn some basic processes like tracking files all the way down to pushing them to a github repository. 
Generally, I have learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
