            <h3>What is Computer Science?</h3>
            <p>Computer Science is the science of computing. Just like Chemistry figures out what chemicals can do, Computer Science figures out what computers can do. And just like chemists create new chemicals, computer scientists create new software to do the things that computers can do.</p>

            <h3>What is the difference between Computer Science (CSC), Computer Information Systems (CIS), and Computer Engineering (CE)?</h3>
            <p>Simple answer: CSC = create software; CIS = apply that software to run a business; CE = create new computers to run that software. A CS major learns science rather than business or engineering. Like all Arts and Science degrees, the CS degree balances science with humanities and social sciences. Technology is important, but you will also have to deal with humans and society. This make a CS degree excellent preparation for law school, an MBA, or even medical school</p>

            <h3>What is the difference between Computer Science and Information Technology?</h3>
            <p>Computer Science studies the underlying principles of computing, leading up to their application in various fields. Information Technology is more concerned with the application of computing, and the tools that are used in application.</p>

            <h3>How much will I make?</h3>
            <p>The median incomes for various Computer Science jobs in the southeast are available from the DataMasters Salary Survey. The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce survey shows that Computer Science graduates earn well above the average.</p>
